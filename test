%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
 %The following are the test cases to be applied to the Helmholtz program,
 %the Helmholtz program will take the following inputs
 %
 %                      Helmholtz(N,w,C), where 
 %             N=number of nodes on the x and y direction
 %             w=the relaxation parameter, to use Gauss-Seidel, set this
 %             value to 1, for SOR set this value to any other value but 1
 %             within the range of 0 to 2
 %             C= setting this value as 1 will have the program run
 %             normally, setting this value to zero will change the code
 %             constants of Gamma and F to be 0
